    "text": "Data Analysis and Design\nThe data revolution has led to an increased interest in the practice of data analysis. While much has been written about statistical thinking, a complementary form of thinking that appears in the practice of data analysis is design thinking – the problem-solving process to understand the people for whom a solution is being designed. For a given problem, there can be significant or subtle differences in how a data analyst (or producer of a data analysis) constructs, creates, or designs a data analysis, including differences in the choice of methods, tooling, and workflow. These choices can affect the data analysis products themselves and the experience of the consumer of the data analysis. Therefore, the role of a producer can be thought of as designing the data analysis with a set of design principles.\nSome questions we hope to address in this work are:\n\nWhat does it mean to “design” a data analysis?\nWhat are the factors that can cause data analyses to be different from one another?\nWhat does it mean for a data analysis to be successful?\nHow do we know when a data analysis is complete or sufficient?\nHow does the consumer of a data analysis contribute to its design and development?"

    "section": "Modeling Analytic Iteration",
    "text": "Modeling Analytic Iteration\nIn 1977, John Tukey described how in exploratory data analysis, data analysts use tools, such as data visualizations, to separate their expectations from what they observe. In contrast to statistical theory, a unique aspect of data analysis is that a data analyst must make decisions in response to observing the data or output from applying a statistical method to the data. However, there is little formal guidance for how to make these data analytic decisions as statistical theory generally omits a discussion of who is using these statistical methods.\nSome questions we hope to address in this work are:\n\nHow do we decide what tools to apply in a data analysis step?\nWhat tools can we develop to make data analysis easier?\nHow can we improve and scale the teaching of data analysis?"

The three individuals gathered at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina in the USA for a four day inaugural meeting on October 16-19, 2023. A panel session with Roger and Stephanie as panelists and Lucy as a moderator was held on October 17th where research topics in the field were introduced and discussed.\nPrior to this 2023 meeting, the foundations and underpinnings of this field were being established as far back as 2018 with both Stephanie Hicks and Roger Peng at Johns Hopkins University with early works as of 2018.\nToday, the field…"

    "section": "Modeling Analytic Iteration",
    "text": "Modeling Analytic Iteration\nIn 1977, John Tukey described how in exploratory data analysis, data analysts use tools, such as data visualizations, to separate their expectations from what they observe. In contrast to statistical theory, a unique aspect of data analysis is that a data analyst must make decisions in response to observing the data or output from applying a statistical method to the data. However, there is little formal guidance for how to make these data analytic decisions as statistical theory generally omits a discussion of who is using these statistical methods.\nSome questions we hope to address in this work are:\n\nHow do we decide what tools to apply in a data analysis step?\nWhat tools can we develop to make data analysis easier?\nHow can we improve and scale the teaching of data analysis?"
